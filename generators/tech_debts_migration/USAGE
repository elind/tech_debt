Description:
    The tech debt migration generator creates a migration for the debt entries.

    The generator takes a migration name as its argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.  'add_exception_table' is the default.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate tech_debt_migration add_tech_debt_table

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddTechDebtTable migration in the
    file db/migrate/5_add_tech_debt_table.rb
